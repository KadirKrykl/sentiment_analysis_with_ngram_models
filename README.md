# Sentiment Analysis With N-gram Models

Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. 
An n-gram model is a type of probabilistic language model for predicting the next item in such a sequence in the form of a (n − 1)–order Markov model.
*In this study, ngram models were used for sentiment analysis.*

## Data Set
Turkish movie reviews were used as the data set. In the "film_elimlari.zip" folder, there are raw text files and information about the people who collected these articles.
Raw text files are divided into 3 folders, which are "positive, negative, neutral".

## Workflow
For detailed information, you can review the notebook page of the coding.
